    "Data that can be fruitfully analyzed with Pandas exist in many forms and locations. Moreover, after performing data analysis/cleanup you need to be able to save your results. As such, Pandas includes several methods that are designed to make File I/0 (input/output) work as smoothly as possible."

    "## Reading/writing flat files\n",
    "The workhorse method for inputting data into a Pandas DataFrame is pd.read_csv(). CSV stands for \"Comma Separated Values,\" and is a very commonly encountered file format for tabular data, since it is human-readable and requires a minimal amount of extra characters to specify what goes where. At its most basic usage, this method takes just a path to a file, and returns a DataFrame:"
